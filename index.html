<h2 align=center style ="font-size:20px">About Illuminati </h2>
<p align=center style="color:red">GRAVITY FALLS SPOILER ALERT!</p>
<p style="color:black">Illuminati has existed in this Universe since the beggining of time. Ancient civilaztions of Maya believed that the all-seeing eye is their god.</p>
<p>According to the latest research Maya's beliefs were wrong, but they had interesting points worth investigation.</p>
<p>In 1981 a scientist called Stanford Pines found ancient cave drawings about something people called "The all-seeing Eye". Stanford started his research on this object.</p>
<p>Stanford claimed that "The all-seeing Eye" appeared in his dreams giving him directions to follow to meet it. In fact he was talking about how intelligent was "The all-seeing Eye"</p>
<p>On January 18, 1982, Ford and Fiddleford performed their first trial with the active portal releasing "The all-seeing Eye" into our dimension. Although it was half-a-fail.</p>
<p>"The all-seeing Eye" introduced himself as Bill Cypher and upong further investigaion he is classified as Dream Demon. Bill told Stanford that the without a proper portal he can't acquire physical form therefore completely exist in our dimension.</p>
<p>Some time later a reiable portal was built, but at uppong launching the portal Stanford understood that Bill has tricked him and the portal was a gateaway to bring chaos from Nightmare realm.</p>
<p>He turned off portal and after some time Standford got into a fight with his brother resulting into trapping Standford in another dimension.</p>
